@node History
@section History
QuIP has been developed continously over a period
of several decades, under a series of flavors of UNIX.
The QuIP interpreter is a front end for a number of libraries;
some of these are system libraries, such as X Windows and OpenGL
for image display, and Motif for GUI widgets.  Other libraries
are distributed as part of the QuIP package, and provide support
for various specialized functions, including support for a variety
of hardware devices, and psychophysical experimentation.
It provides an environment for visual and numerical
computing similar in functionality to Matlab and the like.
